# Beeswarm Plot — Employee Salary Distribution Analysis

**Email:** 23ds2000079@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
**Visualization:** RAWGraphs Beeswarm Plot  
**Business Context:** Pay equity & compensation analysis across departments

## Overview
This visualization analyzes employee salary distribution across different departments and experience levels. A Beeswarm Plot is used because it is ideal for displaying salary dispersion and identifying inequities that bar charts or pie charts cannot reveal.

The data reflects realistic salary patterns for a large enterprise, where seniority and department significantly influence compensation.

## Data Structure
The dataset contains 20 rows with:
- department (categorical)
- level (categorical)
- salary (continuous)

This structure aligns perfectly with RAWGraphs Beeswarm Plot requirements.

## Visualization Details
- Created using **https://rawgraphs.io/**
- Chart Type: **Beeswarm Plot**
- Dimensions: **400 × 400 px**
- Color encodes department; position encodes salary; grouping encodes experience level.
- Exported as **chart.png**
