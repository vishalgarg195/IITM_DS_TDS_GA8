# Customer Analytics: Customer Lifetime Value vs Acquisition Cost

**Email:** 23ds2000079@ds.study.iitm.ac.in  
**Course:** IITM BS – Tools in Data Science  
**Assignment:** GA8 – Seaborn Visualization

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project generates a **professional-grade Seaborn scatterplot** to analyze the relationship between:

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**  

The visualization is designed for **executive-level reporting**, helping a retail client optimize marketing spend and evaluate customer profitability. It follows the principles taught in the *Data Visualization with Seaborn* module.

---

## 🧠 Business Context

A major retail client has approached Stark Braun, a customer analytics company, to understand how acquisition costs relate to long-term customer value.  
The final visualization will be used in:

- Quarterly business review  
- Board presentations  
- Marketing budget strategy discussions  

This repository includes the Python script and resulting image.

# CAC Analysis — Financial Services Performance Analysis

**Author / Contact:** 23ds2000079@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Overview

This repository contains a short analysis of Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for 2024 (quarterly). The executive team observed that CAC is substantially above industry benchmarks. This analysis provides a concise data story, visualizations, and operational recommendations focused on the theme: **optimize digital marketing channels**.

## Data (2024 Quarterly CAC)

- Q1: 226.45  
- Q2: 225.59  
- Q3: 233.28  
- Q4: 230.13  

**Average (2024): 228.86**

**Industry Target (Benchmark): 150**

---

## Key Findings

1. **CAC is consistently elevated** across all quarters (range: 225.59–233.28), showing no quarter with CAC near the industry target of 150.  
2. **Average CAC (228.86)** is ~52% above the industry target, indicating structural channel inefficiencies or overly expensive acquisition tactics.  
3. Minor quarter-to-quarter variation suggests the issue is persistent rather than seasonal.

## Business Implications

- Marketing spend is delivering diminishing returns: the high CAC reduces customer lifetime margin and constrains profitable growth.  
- If unchecked, current CAC trends will erode marketing ROI and compress marketing budgets across business lines.  
- The company should prioritize quick wins (channel optimization) and medium-term changes (creative and funnel improvements).

## Recommendations — **Optimize Digital Marketing Channels**

1. **Reallocate spend to highest-ROI channels**  
   - Identify top-performing channels by cost-per-acquisition (CPA) and lifetime value (LTV:CAC) and shift spend away from poor performers.  
2. **Run rapid A/B tests on creative & landing pages**  
   - Test CTAs, offers, and landing page designs with clear KPI tracking to reduce bounce and improve conversion at lower cost.  
3. **Adjust bidding strategy and caps**  
   - Enforce bid caps on programmatic campaigns and reduce overbidding on low-margin segments.  
4. **Improve audience targeting**  
   - Use lookalike audiences built from high-LTV customer cohorts and exclude low-quality traffic sources.  
5. **Prioritize retention & referral**  
   - Lower CAC by increasing customer lifetime value via retention programs and incentivized referrals.  
6. **Tactical budget rebalancing**  
   - Pause or reduce high-CAC non-performing campaigns while reallocating testing budget to emerging high-potential channels.
